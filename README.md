# Stratification_MC_QMC_ENSAE_2023
Implementation of theoretical models as working code. We compared classical MC with QMC and importance sampling.  
We also implement our own QMC algorithm based on Haber estimator described in "Higher-order stochastic integration through cubic stratification by Nicolas Chopin, Mathieu Gerber".

## Setup

The code can simply be run on Google Colab.
